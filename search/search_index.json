Fragments have a very low chance (estimated 1/250 - 1/1000) of dropping when killing an enemy. They may also be acquired by a few quests. Each enemy has the potential of dropping a fragment unique to that named enemy (i.e. 'Mantis', 'Grimlock Guard'). These fragments can be used to empower items, like an enchantment, which provides the item with additional effects. Some effects are seemingly minor, such as Fragment of Viper (+25 HP), whereas other fragments can potentially define entire character playstyles, such as Fragment of Medusa (-1 Spell Lines) and Fragment of Shamansyth (allows any weapon to be used by Rogues). Usage Items are empowered by fragments by placing the item you wish to empower in the first slot of your inventory and double-clicking the fragment. A window explaining the fragment will appear and you will be able to confirm that you wish to expend the fragment to empower the item. Each fragment can only empower a single type of item (i.e. boots, gloves, etc.). When a fragment is used, it is destroyed. You can empower a single item with up to two fragments. These can be two of the same type of fragments or different types of fragments. When you empower an item with a fragment, its name will change to reflect that it is empowered. If you are the first player to create a particular fragment-item combination, you will have 'discovered' the item, and it will be announced to the entire server. You will also gain a legend mark reflecting the number of items you have discovered. Removing Fragments You can remove fragments from armour by visiting Randel at the Tagor Dark Wizard. You have the option of destroying the item to preserve and reclaim the fragments (one or both) or destroying the fragments to preserve and reclaim the item. This will cost you 250,000 Gold. You cannot preserve both the item and the fragments. Grand Master Gear You cannot empower \"Enchanted\" (Grand Master) gear with \"basic rift fragments\". This gear can only be empowered with \"ascended fragments\". List Warning The following information is still a work in progress!

Name Approximate Level Range Notes Mileth Crypt (1-3) 3 - 15 Enemies on floors 1 and 2 have no elemental defense. Tagor Path 8 - 20 All enemies are undead. Effective for solo Priests. Astrid (South) 11 - 25 All enemies are passive. Dubhaim Castle 20 - 50 Dunans drop Talos Fragments. Effective for solo Priests. Lynith Sea 31 - 55 All enemies are passive in entrance. House Macabre (Nikuru) 41 - 50 Nikuru are passive. Undine Field (North) 50 - 65 Wraith Pit (Mileth Crypt 20) 60+ Instance lasts for 2 hours, and there's a 4 hour cooldown. Cthonic Remains (11-30) 61 - 99 Kasmanium Mines 65 - 99 Ice Caves 70+ Very useful place for leeching level 70+ characters. Loures Canals 90+ Will need bashers. All enemies in the first two rooms are water defense. Oren Ruins 99 Very high experience with Wizards casting Gar spells. Example Progression The following are typically the areas I hunt when leveling a new character: Name Approximate Level Range Mileth Crypt East Woodlands Astrid (Leech) 1 - 20 Dubhaim Castle 20 - 50 Undine Field (North) 50 - 70 Ice Caves (Leech) 70+ Oren Ruins Chaos 99+ XP Drain Every additional group member drains a small amount of XP (~5% of solo XP) that would be granted to the group. Additionally, the level difference between the highest level group member and lowest level group member should not be more than 20. A difference of 20 or greater will result in a severe experience penalty for group members. XP Loss In order to receive full experience for a kill, your character will need to be within 15 levels of the slain monster. Group Composition Although group compositions can be varied, it's generally important to have access to the spell \"Fas Nadur\" (or its variants) and healing. This generally means bringing a Wizard and Priest to every group. Monks, Warriors, and Rogues can be great damage dealers, with Monks and Warriors being able to take damage from enemies and rogues providing crowd control abilities. While not necessary, it can be very helpful to have someone read the elements of the enemies' defense. Otherwise, you will have to guess the defensive elements, which will likely involve rotating through your elemental necklaces or elemental attacks until you find one that does the amount of damage you're expecting. Sign Quests There are signs that exist in hunting areas throughout Temuair. These signs will offer quests to slay 10 of a particular kind of enemy and reward you with a level-appropriate amount of XP for completing the quest. You can do these quests 4 (?) times per day, per location (i.e. Mileth Crypt, East Woodlands, etc.). However, it is possible that if you level into a different level bracket, you may be able to do quests again at a particular location after previously completing them all. It's worthwhile grabbing these sign quests regularly while hunting, if it doesn't take too long to travel back and forth. Aggro For some particular enemies, aggro (short for \"aggressive/ness\") will not be dropped by leaving their vision. Instead, they will continue to chase you accross the map until either something else draws their attention or you leave the map. Experience Boost A server-wide experience boost of 10% can be triggered for 30 minutes by giving the beggar in East Woodlands 5,000,000 Gold. Experience Needed The following is a table of how much experience you need in order to level. This table is an estimation of the leveling formula, and appears to be inaccurate by no more than 5 XP at any level.

After completing a necessary quest, you can ascend for health and mana by placing a succubus hair into the Mileth altar and speaking with either Deoch (health) or Gramail (mana). Furthermore, you can purchase stats in exchange for health or experience by speaking with Bedor in the Temple of Choosing in Mileth. Ascension Quest In order to be able to ascend, you need to complete the quest to slay the Bone Dragon at the bottom of the Kasmanium Mines, given to you by Ludar in Camp A'Chaid. After slaying the Bone Dragon, be sure to speak with Ludar again to fully complete the quest. Pre-Max Stats Experience Please see the stats calculator to calculate how much experience is required to max your stats. When ascending for stats directly at the Temple of Choosing, the experience cost formula appears to be as follows. Credit goes to Pablito for discovering this formula. Let STAT be the current base value of the stat you're going to raise. Before Transcending XP COST = STAT * (BASE HP) * 17 After Transcending XP COST = STAT * (BASE HP) * 20 Example For example, if my base HP is 5000, haven't transcended, and I want to raise my strength from 100 to 101 then it will cost: XP COST = 100 * (5000 * 17) XP COST = 8,500,000 Post-Max Stats When increasing stats beyond the your class-specific maximum for that stat , the cost to increase the stat is as follows: Let STAT be the current base value of the stat you're going to raise. XP COST = STAT * 500,000 Example For example, if I am a Warrior, and I want to raise my strength from 250 to 251: XP COST = 250 * 500,000 XP COST = 125,000,000 HP Please see the HP calculator to calculate how much experience is required to increase your HP. When ascending for health by speaking to Deoch, the experience cost formula appears to be as follows: 50 HP XP COST = (BASE HP) * 500 500 HP XP COST = (BASE HP) * 5000 It is most efficient to buy 500 HP at a time, as you pay the cost relative to the starting point, rather than the increased cost at every 50 HP increment. MP Please see the MP calculator to calculate how much experience is required to increase your MP. When ascending for mana by speaking to Gramail, the experience cost formula appears to be as follows: 25 MP XP COST = (BASE MP) * 500 250 HP XP COST = (BASE MP) * 5000 It is most efficient to buy 250 MP at a time, as you pay the cost relative to the starting point, rather than the increased cost at every 25 MP increment. Remarks You should consider only purchasing stats with experience when your HP is at or near its minimum (4000). When done this way, you will spend less experience overall when maxing your stats . Once a particular stat is higher than 150, it may be more effecient in terms of experience to purchase stats one by one by ascending for 250 HP and turning that HP into one stat. However, this will require you to use a Succubus hair for every stat point placed using this method.","title":"Ascending"},{"location":"classes/ascending/#ascending","text":"Ascending is the process of exchanging experience for more character power: health, mana, and stats.

However, you can choose your path at level 5 at the Temple of Choosing in Mileth. This will likely be one of the most important choices you make. There are five paths an Aisling can go down: Monk, Priest, Rogue, Warrior, and Wizard. Every class has unique strengths and weaknesses: Monk Monks fight with their powerful hands and feet. They are very defensive and have a variety of useful spells. Priest Priests support their group with healing spells, as well as a variety of beneficial spells and curses. Rogue Rogues excel when fighting indirectly: studying their enemies, attacking from behind, and using traps. Warrior Warriors fight with a variety of weapons and shields. They want to get in close and hit the enemy hard. Wizard Wizards are the masters of magic elements. They cast elemental spells and augment or change the elements of their enemies. Class Names While your class name remains the same if you do not choose a subpath , those who do subpath will be given a class name according to the combination of their first class and second class. \u2193 First / Second \u2192 Monk Priest Rogue Warrior Wizard Monk Monk Acolyte Blackguard Warmonger Geomancer Priest Druid Priest Vagabond Paladin Scholar Rogue Sura Shadow Priest Rogue Mercenary Shadowmage Warrior Champion Crusader Chaser Warrior Swordmage Wizard Dark Druid Cleric Trickster Stormbreaker Wizard Super Peasant There is an additional hidden class: the Super Peasant. Please read the Super Peasant page for more information. Progression As your character grows in power, you may eventually subclass , master your class, become a grand master , and transcend your class. Class Summaries Monks Pure Monk Druid Sura Champion Dark Druid Priests Pure Priest Acolyte Shadow Priest Crusader Cleric Rogues Pure Rogue Blackguard Vagabond Chaser Trickster Warriors Pure Warrior Warmonger Pros Very strong physical damage. Monk abilities synergize well with Warrior. Can use Monk kicks while wielding a weapon. 0-line Dion. Howl is very useful for drawing enemies' attention. Can remove blindness and poison. Choice of Monk form is meaningful and powerful. Cons No Pure Warrior stances or abilities. Weaker Crasher than Pure Warrior. Comparable Classes Pure Warrior : Pure Warrior has access to more Warrior abilities, but loses much of the self-sufficiency of Warmonger (Dion, cures) and utility that the Monk class provides (Ambush, forms, Wolf Fang Fist). Champion : Champion trades post-Master Warrior abilities for post-Master Monk abilities. A Warmonger's assail damage will likely be stronger, but a Champion's skill damage will likely be stronger. Paladin Pros Access to healing. Ability to remove debuffs (Suain, Dall, Puinsein). Ability to buff. Access to Dion and Deireas Faileas. Cons Lacking many damaging abilities that that many other Warrior-ending classes would have. No ability to read elements. Takes a lot of work before the class starts to work well. Very much needs spell line upgrades. Comparable Classes Warmonger : Warmonger's Monk abilities cover some of the same benefits the Priest class gives Paladin: removing blindness and poison, and 0-line Dion. Paladins can remove Suain, whereas Warmongers cannot. Warmongers have many more abilities to deal damage, whereas Paladins have access to priest debuff abilities (curses, Suain, Pramh, Dall). However, these abilities are hard to use without spell line upgrades. Stormbreaker : Like the Paladin, Stormbreaker very much benefits from difficult to obtain spell line upgrades. Stormbreaker trades healing, cures, and debuffs for Fas Nadur and offensive elemental spells. Stormbreaker has the ability to gather enemies quickly with Gar spells and can read elements, but will be vulnerable to debuffs, such as Suain. Stormbreaker may also (with many, many upgrades) be able to use both physical and magical attacks effectively, and perform better when fighting enemies that have varied defensive resistances. Mercenary Stormbreaker Wizards Pure Wizard Geomancer Pros Monk abilities synergize well with Wizard abilities. Can cure blindness and poison, cast Inner Fire, and see invisible. Access to Wraith Touch (dark damage) and Beag Nochd (wind damage) spells. Access to 0-line Dion. White Bat form grants invisibility and read elements. Cons No Elementalist (slightly weaker Gars). Comparable Classes Scholar : The Priest abilities of Scholar cover many of the advantages that Monk brings to Geomancer (cures, Dion) and can access stealth through the Fiosachd Relic. Geomancer's Beag Nochd will be stronger than a Scholar's Ard Athar. Scholar has a few light spells, whereas Geomancer has one dark spell. Pure Wizard : Pure Wizard gains Elementalist and some utility spells, but loses the self-sufficiency of Geomancer. Scholar Pros Powerful priest and wizard spells. Highly synergistic spells. Can play as support or damage-dealer. Can heal self after casting Fas Spiorad. Cons No Elementalist (slightly weaker Gars). Dion will be 1-line until spell-line gear is obtained. Comparable Classes Cleric : Cleric is very similar to Scholar, but more Priest than Wizard. You will likely function more as a healer than as a damage dealer, at least until you get a lot more mana. Cleric won't be able to deal as much damage as a comparable Scholar, but you will have access to and have synergy with powerful Wizard spells.

Stormbreaker has the ability to gather enemies quickly with Gar spells and can read elements, but will be vulnerable to debuffs, such as Suain. Stormbreaker may also (with many, many upgrades) be able to use both physical and magical attacks effectively, and perform better when fighting enemies that have varied defensive resistances. Mercenary Stormbreaker","title":"Warriors"},{"location":"classes/overview/#wizards","text":"Pure Wizard Geomancer Pros Monk abilities synergize well with Wizard abilities. Can cure blindness and poison, cast Inner Fire, and see invisible. Access to Wraith Touch (dark damage) and Beag Nochd (wind damage) spells. Access to 0-line Dion. White Bat form grants invisibility and read elements. Cons No Elementalist (slightly weaker Gars). Comparable Classes Scholar : The Priest abilities of Scholar cover many of the advantages that Monk brings to Geomancer (cures, Dion) and can access stealth through the Fiosachd Relic. Geomancer's Beag Nochd will be stronger than a Scholar's Ard Athar. Scholar has a few light spells, whereas Geomancer has one dark spell. Pure Wizard : Pure Wizard gains Elementalist and some utility spells, but loses the self-sufficiency of Geomancer. Scholar Pros Powerful priest and wizard spells. Highly synergistic spells. Can play as support or damage-dealer. Can heal self after casting Fas Spiorad. Cons No Elementalist (slightly weaker Gars). Dion will be 1-line until spell-line gear is obtained. Comparable Classes Cleric : Cleric is very similar to Scholar, but more Priest than Wizard. You will likely function more as a healer than as a damage dealer, at least until you get a lot more mana. Cleric won't be able to deal as much damage as a comparable Scholar, but you will have access to and have synergy with powerful Wizard spells.

This is somewhat difficult because priests need a lot of stats to learn all of their pre-master spells. However, it is possible to sub with all spells and extra stats using various items, but your final stats may vary slightly depending on what items you have access to. You can choose any religion , but remember to incorporate those gained stats as part of your base stats. Choosing Ceannlaidir or Sgrios will make the stat plan more challenging, but still possible.

Of course, there are many different strategies for allocating stats and this is not a definitive guide, but the following will be an overview of character stats and some general advice. Primary Stat Effect Strength Increases the damage of assails (melee attacks) Increases carrying capacity Every 15 gives +1% Stun Resist Intelligence Increases the damage of spells Wisdom Increases mana regeneration Increases mana gained per level Constitution Increases health regeneration Increases health gained per level Increases the damage of some Monk abilities Every 15 gives +1% Blind Resist Dexterity Improves hit rate (?) Increases the damage of some Rogue and Warrior abilities Every 15 gives +1% Poison Resist General Advice In general, it's important to invest most of your early stats into Constitution, Wisdom, or both (depending or your class). This is because the amount of health and mana you gain per level is dependent on your Constitution and Wisdom, respectively, and the earlier you invest in these stats the more levels there are to benefit from the investment. Depending on what sort of access to stat items you have, you may need to put a few points in other stats to function as your class, but you should try to put as many points in Consitution and Wisdom as early as possible (as makes sense for your class). Additionally, whether or not you plan on subbing can change how you want to place your stats. When subbing from Priest or Wizard, you will likely need to be very careful in your stat placement, and not raise any one stat too highly, whereas these concerns don't matter as much if you're going Pure. Notably, although Intelligence is an important stat for Wizards, if you're subbing from a Wizard to another class, you won't need very much Intelligence to obtain all your spells. However, a Wizard that is going Pure would benefit very much from having a high Intelligence. Maximum Stats Before transcending your character, the maximum stats you can obtain depends on your class.

Drop Rate Bonus An increase in the probability of items dropping. Note: if an item normally has a drop rate of 10%, then a +10% drop rate bonus will make the drop rate become 11% (not 20%).

Goblin Armour Pieces can be found randomly by slaying goblins through Temuair (West Woodlands, East Woodlands, etc.). The Goblin Armour Piece does not drop from the slain goblin to the ground, but rather will appear directly in your inventory after slaying the goblin. You can exchange Goblin Armour Pieces for level 41 armour as many times as you would like. Level 71 Armour The Grounds Keeper of Dubhaim Castle Grounds will craft level 71 armour of your class, after defeating a Dubhaim Cleric, in exchange for Dubhaim Cloth. The Grounds Keeper is located on the north side of the Dubhaim Castle Grounds (13, 9) and will only speak to Aislings if they can trust you're not dangerous. In order to convince the Grounds Keeper you're not dangerous, say \"Greetings\" out loud. The Keeper will give you a quest to venture into Dubhaim and defeat a Dubhaim Cleric. The altar for summoning Dubhaim Clerics can be found in Dubhaim Castle North (entrance 34, 10). Proceed to Dubhaim Castle North 4-3, turn west, and enter Dubhaim Castle North 5-1. You will need to place Dubhaim skulls (Ghast Fiend, Gargoyle, etc.) into the altar in order to summon a creature. Often, further ghasts and gargoyles will be summoned, but sometimes a Dubhaim Cleric will be summoned. Defeat the Dubhaim Cleric and obtain Dubhaim Cloth. Return to the Grounds Keeper with your Dubhaim Cloth and they will craft your level 71 armour. You can continue to exchange Dubhaim Cloth for more level 71 armour. Level 97 Armour Level 97 armour is crafted by obtaining a Kasmanium Chest from the Dracos of Kasmanium Mines. Alternatively, one of the quests offered by Ludar in Camp A'Chiad will have you slay a boss at the bottom of the mines and reward you with a Kasmanium Chest. Open the Kasmanium Chest, take the armour piece to Camp A'Chiad on the fifth floor of Kasmanium Mines, and drop the armour piece into the forge (2, 6). You will receive the level 97 armour of your class. You may repeat this any number of times to obtain more armours.","title":"Armour Crafting"},{"location":"crafting/armour_crafting/#armour-crafting","text":"Although most low-level armour is bought from merchants throughout Temuair, high level armour (41-97) must be crafted in a variety of ways.","title":"Armour Crafting"},{"location":"crafting/armour_crafting/#level-41-armour","text":"The Goblin Blacksmith of Aibreann Forest (East Woodlands path leading into 6-1) will craft level 41 Aisling armour of your class in exchange for a Goblin Armour Piece.

Gem Polishing allows rogues to polish Beryls, Corals, Rubies, and Talos into higher qualities. When the Gem Polishing ability is active, drop the gem you wish to polish at your character's feet. If successful, the gem will improve in quality from \"Fragment\", \"Uncut\", \"Flawed\", and finally \"Finished\". When a gem is successfuly polished from Flawed to Finished (regardless of whether it was found Flawed or polished into Flawed), you will gain one rank in Gem Smithing, which will appear in your Legend. At Gem Smithing level 50, you will gain the \"Master Gem Smith\" Legend Mark and no longer have a chance of breaking gems when polishing. Polishing gems requires one day of labour. However, there is a percentage chance (equal to your dexterity) that the labour from polishing will be refunded. It is therefore possible to polish any number of gems, without any chance of breaking or labour usage, when you are a Master Gem Smith with a Dexterity of at least 100. If you're looking to improve your Gem Smithing ability, one strategy is to wait until you have a high amount of Dexterity, and then purchase gems at the Rucesion Black Market to polish, as you will break many purchased gem fragments without using much labour. On the other hand, if your dexterity is low, you may wish to exclusively attempt to polish Flawed Gems, as the only time you gain a legend mark is when successfully polishing a Flawed gem to a Finished gem.

However, both the Gold and the Talgonite Bar are consumed, regardless of whether the upgrade was successful or not. You cannot upgrade gear that is enchanted with Fragments. You must first remove the fragments, thereby destroying either the fragments or the item. If you are the first player on the server to upgrade a particular item to a new upgrade level, you will have 'discovered' the upgraded item, and it will be announced to the entire server. You will also gain a legend mark reflecting the number of items you have discovered.","title":"Upgrading Weapons and Armour"},{"location":"crafting/upgrades/#earrings","text":"Upgrade Level Effect 5 +1 to All Stats 10 +1 to All Stats -1 AC +1% Drop Rate +1% XP","title":"Earrings"},{"location":"crafting/upgrades/#gloves","text":"Upgrade Level Effect 2 -1 Weight Reduction 5 +1 to All Stats","title":"Gloves"},{"location":"crafting/upgrades/#greaves","text":"Upgrade Level Effect 2 -1 Weight Reduction 4 -1 Weight Reduction 5 +1 to All Stats","title":"Greaves"},{"location":"crafting/upgrades/#belt","text":"Upgrade Level Effect 5 +1 to All Stats Elemental Resistance 10 +1 to All Stats Elemental Resistance -1 AC +1% Drop Rate +1% XP","title":"Belt"},{"location":"crafting/upgrades/#ring","text":"Upgrade Level Effect 5 +1 to All Stats 10 +1 to All Stats -1 AC +1% Drop Rate +1% XP","title":"Ring"},{"location":"crafting/upgrades/#neck","text":"Upgrade Level Effect 5 +1 to All Stats","title":"Neck"},{"location":"crafting/upgrades/#boots","text":"Upgrade Level Effect 2 -1 Weight Reduction 5 +1 to All Stats 10 +1 to All Stats -1 AC +1% Drop Rate +1% XP","title":"Boots"},{"location":"crafting/upgrades/#shield","text":"Upgrade Level Effect 2 -1 Weight Reduction 4 -1 Weight Reduction 5 +1 to All Stats","title":"Shield"},{"location":"crafting/upgrades/#weapons","text":"Upgrade Level Effect Every 1 Increased minimum and maximum damage.

The trial consists of five rounds, comprised mostly of enemies found throughout the Asilon Prairie. Almost all enemies are aggressive and cast ao sith and pramh. You should avoid healers getting aggro, so that they can remain buffed and ressurect teammates without problems. You should probably have a group of 3 or more people. Round 1 You will need to defeat all the enemies on the map. You should try to only pull a few at a time, unless you're confident in your abilities. Round 2 Very similar to the previous round. You will need to defeat all enemies. Round 3 The boss is non-aggresive, but moves quickly and appears to change its physical and magical resistances over time. Try to trap the boss so that it can't move and freeze / poison / blind the boss as much as possible. Round 4 There will be enemies all over the map.

Completing the Medusa Creant quest is part of Grand Mastering and is required to transcend your class. Quest In order to create the Medusa Talisman, you will need to collect: Left Talisman Half Right Talisman Half Polished Pearl Pouch of Gems These Oren Ruins maps (external site) may be helpful when navigating the ruins. Polished Pearl In order to obtain the Polished Pearl, you will first need to travel to the Nobis Pub in Nobis Village and speak with Duncan to purchase a Dusty Pearl for 1,000,000 Gold. You can reach Nobis Village by first travelling to Oren. After arriving at Oren, you can click on the Oren Codex by the docks to travel instantly to the Oren City tower. From the tower, travel north until you reach the entrance to Oren Jungle (50, 1). Continue north through Oren Jungle until you reach the Nobis gates (29, 19). Say, \"Welcome Aisling\" out loud to enter the gates. You will arrive at the Nobis Passage. From the Nobis Passage, travel west until you reach Nobis Village (1 ,11). Duncan can be found in the corner of the Nobis Pub (Nobis Village - 29, 49). Speak with him to purchase a Dusty Pearl for 1,000,000 Gold. You transform your Dusty Pearl into a Polished Pearl by entering Lynith Sea 1. Note that the first underwater room of Lynith Sea is called \"Lynith Sea\", but you need to enter the second underwater room, called \"Lynith Sea 1\". Upon entering the room, you will receive a message saying your pearl has been transformed. Talisman Halves The Left and Right Talisman Halves can be found as drops from monsters in the Oren Ruins, which you will travel through in order to collect your Pouch of Gems. You will likely complete this part of the quest while defeating enemies while you travel and I recommend starting with the the Pouch of Gems before (explicitly) farming the Talisman Halves. The Left Talisman Half drops from monsters on the second floor of Oren Ruins and the Right Talisman Half drops from enemies on the third floor of Oren Ruins. Pouch of Gems Collecting the Pouch of Gems is the most time-intensive part of the Medusa Creant quest. In summary, you will need to dig up bones in Oren Ruins and then summon a chain of mini-bosses throughout Oren Ruins. The Oren Ruins can be accessed by travelling north through Oren Village (30, 1). You should walk through the gate, rather than around, as it is considered bad luck not to do so. While you are travelling throughout the Oren Ruins, you may wish to not cas Fas Nadur on yourself, as enemies cast Light elemental spells and have Dark melee attacks. Be warned that Gorgons spawn in all the boss rooms, so it is not safe to go AFK while in those rooms. Copper Bones You will need to collect nine Copper Bones throughout the outside part of Oren Ruins. In order to dig up the bones, you will need to buy a shovel and assail with it equipped. If you cannot unequip your equipped weapon because of subpathing, it is possible to have another character dig up with bones for you. However, there is a cooldown between the time any character can dig up the same bones twice. Oren Ruins 1-5 Copper Bone 1: (10, 19) Oren Ruins 1-6 Copper Bone 2: (43, 47) Copper Bone 3: (12, 31) Oren Ruins 1-7 Copper Bone 4 and 5: (65, 32) Oren Ruins 1-8 Copper Bone 6: (12, 32) Copper Bone 7: (57, 22) Copper Bone 9: (65, 83) Copper Bone 8: (10, 82) When you are finished digging up the bones, you should have a total of nine Copper Bone pieces. Ruby Gemstone The Ruby Gemstone is obtained by using your Copper Bones to summon the Copper Draco in the Oren Ruins Altar 1 room (accessed from Oren Ruins 2-16). The Copper Draco is Dark defense and Dark attack. You may need to recast debuffs if the Draco clears them. Suain makes the fight much easier. The Copper Draco drops the Ruby Gemstone and also has a chance of dropping the same kind of bones that are dug up outside in the Oren Ruins. It may be possible to summon additional Dracos if you get enough of such bones. Sapphire Gemstone The Sapphire Gemstone is obtained by defeating the Ancient Lava Golem in the Oren Ruins Altar 2 room (accessed from Oren Ruins 2-10). Summoning the Golem will consume your Ruby Gemstone, but reward you with a Sapphire Gemstone. The Lava Golem has Fire Defense, so be sure to use Sea element when fighting it. You may need to recast debuffs in the fight. Suain makes the fight much easier. Amber Gemstone The Amber Gemstone is obtained by defeating the Ancient Fire Hydraco in the Oren Ruins Altar 3 room (accessed from Oren Ruins 3-10). Summoning the Hydraco will consume your Sapphire Gemstone, but reward you with an Amber Gemstone. The first phase has Fire defense. The second phase has Light defense. The third phase has Dark defense. You may need to cast debuffs if the fight goes slowly. Suain makes the fight much easier. Obtaining the Pouch The Pouch of Gems is obtained by defeating the Ancient Fire Drake in the Oren Ruins Altar 4 room (accessed from Oren Ruins 3-16). Summoning the Drake will consume your Amber Gemstone, but reward you with a Pouch of Gems. The Drake has Dark defense. You may need to recast debuffs in the fight. Suain makes the fight much easier. Medusa Talisman Ensure you have all the requirements in order to create the Medusa Talisman: Left Talisman Half Right Talisman Half Polished Pearl Pouch of Gems Return to Duncan in the Nobis Pub (Nobis Village - 29, 49). Tell him that you found talisman pieces and he will forge them into an Empty Talisman. If you speak to him again, he will forge the Medusa Talisman by combining the Empty Talisman with your Polished Pearl and Pouch of Gems. Medusa Creant Fight The Medusa is summoned in the Oren Ruins Altar 5 room (accessed from Oren Ruins 3-2). Medusa has a random defensive element, so be sure to read the element to know which offensive element to use. You will need to recast debuffs in the fight, as Medusa will remove them regularly from herself. Keeping Suain cast on Medusa will make the fight much easier. She will summon a small amount of monsters (1-3) a few times in the fight when her health drops below certain thresholds.

Completing the Taurent Creant quest is part of Grand Mastering and is required to transcend your class. Quest In order to summon Tauren, you will need to collect: Kelberoth Lock Goblin Chief's Gauntlet This Mount Giragan map (external site) may be helpful when navigating the Mount Giragan. Kelberoth Lock In order to obtain a Kelberoth Lock, will need to travel to the Kelberoth Ice Caves and defeat the Kelberoth. You can reach the Kelberoth Ice Caves by first travelling to Mount Giragan and continuing until the Mt. Giragan 6 intersection room, travelling north until Mt. Giragan 18, and then travelling west until Mt. Giragan 21. The entrance to the caves is on the western wall. In order to summon a Kelberoth, you must find Wolf Bait, which has a somewhat low chance of dropping from Giragan Wolves in the Ice Caves. You will need one Wolf Bait for every member of your party. Take the Wolf Bait to Ice Cave 4 and summon a Kelberoth by walking into the center of the room with the bait in your inventory. Kelberoth The Kelberoth will repeatedly cast a wave spell directly in front of him, so you may want to face him away from the other members of your party. You should cast Ard Cradh on him and keep him Suain'd as much as possible. The Kelberoth has Dark defense. Goblin Chief's Gauntlet In order to obtain a Goblin Chief's Gauntlet, will need to travel to the Goblin Ice Caves and defeat the Goblin Chief. The Goblin Ice Caves can be accessed by travelling south from Mt. Giragan 6 until Mt. Giragan 27, travelling east until Mt. Giragan 30, and then entering the caves, which are located along the eastern wall. You will need to obtain the Chief's Notes in the caves in order to summon the Goblin Chief. Chief's Notes You will first need to obtain the Chief's Notes, which can be obtained by speaking with the Goblin Scout in Goblin Fort Ung Oh'k, which is accessed by travelling north through Ice Cave 15. You will need to say \"Notes\" out loud. These notes can be used to summon the Goblin Chief. Goblin Chief The Goblin Chief is summoned in \"Ice Cave\", which is accessed by travelling north continually from Ice Cave 14, until you reach a room with a throne and treasure. You summon the Chief by standing near the throne. The Goblin Chief will repeatedly cast a wave spell directly in front of him, so you may want to face him away from the other members of your party. You should cast Ard Cradh on him and keep him Suain'd as much as possible. The Goblin Chief has Dark defense. Tauren Creant Fight The Tauren is summoned in the Ice Caves Altar room, which is accessed at the end of the Tauren Ice Caves. You can reach the Tauren Ice Caves by travelling to Mt. Giragan 12, and eventering the caves on the southern wall. Skeletons will continue to randomly spawn in the room. They will have Dark defense and Dark attack, but occassionally cast Light spells, so you may wish to wear a Dark belt, but not be Fas'd. The Tauren is summoned by standing in front of the ice with a Kelberoth Lock and a Goblin Chief's Gauntlet in your inventory. Tauren has Dark defense and Dark attack. You will need to recast debuffs in the fight, as Tauren will remove them regularly from himself. Keeping Suain cast on Tauren will make the fight much easier.
