## Choosing a Class

<img src="../../images/sprites/male_peasant.png"/> <img src="../../images/sprites/female_peasant.png"/>

Every Aisling starts their adventure as a Peasant. However, you can choose your path at level 5 at the Temple of Choosing in Mileth. This will likely be one of the most important choices you make. There are five paths an Aisling can go down: Monk, Priest, Rogue, Warrior, and Wizard. Every class has unique strengths and weaknesses:

### Monk

Monks fight with their powerful hands and feet. They are very defensive and have a variety of useful spells.

### Priest

Priests support their group with healing spells, as well as a variety of beneficial spells and curses.

### Rogue

Rogues excel when fighting indirectly: studying their enemies, attacking from behind, and using traps.

### Warrior

Warriors fight with a variety of weapons and shields. They want to get in close and hit the enemy hard.

### Wizard

Wizards are the masters of magic elements. They cast elemental spells and augment or change the elements of their enemies.

## Class Names

While your class name remains the same if you do not choose a [subpath](../subbing), those who do subpath will be given a class name according to the combination of their first class and second class.

There is an additional hidden class: the Super Peasant. Please read the [Super Peasant](../super_peasant) page for more information.

## Progression

As your character grows in power, you may eventually [subclass](../subbing), [master](../mastering) your class, become a [grand master](../grand_mastering), and [transcend](../transcending) your class.

## Class Summaries

## Pure Monk

## Dark Druid

## Pure Priest

## Acolyte

## Shadow Priest

## Crusader

## Cleric

## Pure Rogue

## Blackguard

## Vagabond

## Chaser

## Trickster

## Pure Warrior

## Warmonger

**Pros**

- Very strong physical damage.
- Monk abilities synergize well with Warrior.
- Can use Monk kicks while wielding a weapon.
- 0-line Dion.
- Howl is very useful for drawing enemies' attention.
- Can remove blindness and poison.
- Choice of Monk form is meaningful and powerful.

**Cons**

- No Pure Warrior stances or abilities.
- Weaker Crasher than Pure Warrior.

**Comparable Classes**

- **Pure Warrior**: Pure Warrior has access to many more Warrior abilities, but loses much of the self-sufficiency of Warmonger (Dion, cures) and utility that the Monk class provides (Ambush, forms, Wolf Fang Fist).
- **Champion**: Champion trades post-Master Warrior abilities for post-Master Monk abilities. A Warmonger's assail damage will likely be stronger, but a Champion's skill damage will likely be stronger.

## Paladin

**Pros**

- Assail damage is fairly strong.
- Access to healing.
- Ability to remove debuffs (Suain, Dall, Puinsein).
- Ability to buff.
- Access to Dion and Deireas Faileas.

**Cons**

- Lacking many damaging abilities that that many other Warrior-ending classes would have.
- No ability to read elements.
- Takes a lot of work before the class starts to work well.
- Very much needs spell line upgrades.

**Comparable Classes**

- **Warmonger**: Warmonger's Monk abilities cover some of the same benefits the Priest class gives Paladin: removing blindness and poison, and 0-line Dion. Paladins can remove Suain, whereas Warmongers cannot. Warmongers have many more abilities to deal damage, whereas Paladins have access to priest debuff abilities (curses, Suain, Pramh, Dall). However, these abilities are hard to use without spell line upgrades.
- **Stormbreaker**: Like the Paladin, Stormbreaker very much benefits from difficult to obtain spell line upgrades. Stormbreaker trades healing, cures, and debuffs for Fas Nadur and offensive elemental spells. Stormbreaker has the ability to gather enemies quickly with Gar spells and can read elements, but will be vulnerable to debuffs, such as Suain. Stormbreaker may also (with many, many upgrades) be able to use both physical and magical attacks effectively, and perform better when fighting enemies that have varied defensive resistances.

## Mercenary

## Stormbreaker

## Pure Wizard

## Geomancer

Monk -> Wizard

**Pros**

- Powerful spells.
- Monk abilities synergize well with Wizard abilities.
- Can cure blindness and poison, cast Inner Fire, and see invisible.
- Access to Wraith Touch (dark damage) and Beag Nochd (wind damage) spells.
- Access to 0-line Dion.
- White Bat form grants invisibility and read elements.

**Cons**

- No Elementalist (slightly weaker Gars).

**Comparable Classes**

- **Scholar**: The Priest abilities of Scholar cover many of the advantages that Monk brings to Geomancer (cures, Dion) and can access stealth through the Fiosachd Relic. Geomancer's Beag Nochd will be stronger than a Scholar's Ard Athar. Scholar has a few light spells, whereas Geomancer has one dark spell.
- **Pure Wizard**: Pure Wizard gains Elementalist and some utility spells, but loses the self-sufficiency of Geomancer.

## Scholar

Priest -> Wizard

**Pros**

- Powerful priest and wizard spells.
- Highly synergistic spells.
- Can play as support or damage-dealer.
- Can heal self after casting Fas Spiorad.

**Cons**

- No Elementalist (slightly weaker Gars).
- Dion will be 1-line until spell-line gear is obtained.

**Comparable Classes**

- **Cleric**: Cleric is very similar to Scholar, but more Priest than Wizard. You will likely function more as a healer than as a damage dealer, at least until you get a lot more mana. Cleric won't be able to deal as much damage as a comparable Scholar, but you will have access to and have synergy with powerful Wizard spells.

## Shadowmage

## Swordmage
